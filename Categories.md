### 1-User customisable worlds

Since the last hackathon, Gather Chat has built in support for multiple worlds. However, there are currently only three fixed worlds. The next level of this will be having user-created worlds, with the ability to customise it to their liking, and then invite other players there. 

### 2-User 1-1 Chat

It would be nice if the player is near another player they could have the ability to filter the chat stream to just that user. So when looking at the activity tab, we could have an option to filter stream by the players you are next to. For bonus points, you could enable encrypted chat between the participants, or even livestream audio/video.

### 3-Social-like Feed

This feature request is to make the chat panel look like a social feed than a chat room. If users share media or images, embed in the feed via a timeline. Also, maybe list the feed with the newest at at the top. Emojis are a standard in a social experience, it would be great to have the ability to add reactions via the activity feed quickly when making a post, e.g. a "like" button. Also, maybe consider having a chat stream tab for the whole chat and a filtered version based on which world the player is in.

### 4-Notifications

Support notifications via the browser, so if the chat is running in the background users can receive a ping, if their name is mentioned. You could also send a notification to the user's personal process, so they could be notified even if they are not in the chat.

### 5-Embedded Images

AO should support attaching data to a message up to 10 MB, it would be nice to enable the image upload to use AO messages if the image is less than 10 MB. Then give the user the option to use turbo or something else to upload images/media.

### 6-Mobile/Accessibility

Gather Chat currently requires Arconnect on dekstop in order to play. However, it would be great to allow users to play without a wallet or when on mobile. Two ways of doing this would be via a temporary wallet, or with Othent -- an arweave wallet that uses Google OAuth to allow users to connect to AO/Arweave. Also, Gather Chat needs to have the interface overhauled to work on mobile, including an improved layout and touch controls for movement.

### 7-Autonomous worlds

Add non-player characters (NPCs) to the world, which can interact with the player. This could be as simple as a character that moves around the world, or as complex as a character that can give the player quests. You could even power these bots with an LLM, e.g. [ao-llama](https://github.com/samcamwilliams/aos-llama).
