### 1-Customisable rooms

In GatherChat, everyone is just in one space, it would be nice to support rooms or areas that users can gather and filter the chat to that room. Maybe consider having a chat stream tab for the whole chat and a filtered version based on user/room location.

### 2-User 1-1 Chat

It would be nice if a user is near another user they could have the ability to filter the chat stream with just that user. So when looking at the activity tab, we could have an option to filter stream by the users I am next to.

### 3-Social Like Chat Panel

This feature request is to make the chat panel look like a social feed than a chat room. If users share media or images, embed in the feed via a timeline. Also, maybe list the feed with the newest at at the top.

### 4-Reactions

Emojis are a standard in a chat experience, it would be great to have the ability to add reactions via the activity feed quickly when making a post. Also, allow users to react to a post by liking the post.

### 5-Notifications

Support notifications via the browser, so if the chat is running in the background users can receive a ping, if their name is mentioned.

### 6-Embedded Images

AO should support attaching data to a message up to 10 MB, it would be nice to enable the image upload to use AO messages if the image is less than 10 MB. Then give the user the option to use turbo or something else to upload images/media.

### 7-Mobile Support with Othent

Othent is a arweave wallet that uses Google OAuth to allow users to connect to AO/Arweave. This gives AO/Arweave web mobile support out of the box. This feature is to build in mobile support for GatherChat using Othent.
